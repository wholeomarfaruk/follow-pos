 * ecomxFashion engine — storefront routes.

 * Owns WHAT the ecomxFashion storefront does. Route names are stable
 * (ecomx-fashion.*) across every theme this engine has. ecomxFashion is the
 * active theme/engine, so its routes live at the site root (no URL prefix) —
 * route *names* still carry the ecomx-fashion. prefix so nothing that calls
 * route('ecomx-fashion.xxx') needs to change.
 *
 * Loaded once per request by EngineManager::loadActiveThemeRoute(), called
 * from routes/web.php — never require this file directly.
