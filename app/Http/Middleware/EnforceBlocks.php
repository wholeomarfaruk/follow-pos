 * Enforces the full_site block scope on every web request — this is the
 * "user ke site show korbe na" requirement. Runs after DeviceTracker (needs
 * $device already resolved) and after the session starts (needs an
 * authenticated user, if any).
 *
 * DeviceTracker's own visit logging is untouched by this: it runs in
 * DeviceTracker::terminate(), after this middleware has already decided
 * whether to abort — so a blocked visitor's attempt still shows up in the
 * Visits tab, only the response they receive is a 404.
 *
 * Narrower scopes (orders, checkout, account_panel) are NOT enforced here —
 * see the `block.scope` alias below, applied only to the specific routes
 * that scope covers.
