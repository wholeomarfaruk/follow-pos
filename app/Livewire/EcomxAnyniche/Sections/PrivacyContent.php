 * a hardcoded, non-editable Blade file. Only the "Last updated" date (always
 * today) and the surrounding page chrome (breadcrumb, layout) stay fixed.
 *
 * The sticky table-of-contents sidebar (jtc-legal__toc, part of the
 * original design) is preserved by deriving it from whatever <h2> headings
 * actually exist in the saved body — not a hardcoded list — so an admin
 * editing the content in the rich text editor never has to manually manage
 * anchor ids, and the TOC can never point at a heading that no longer exists.

                    partner so they can complete the delivery and collect payment. We do not store any cash-handling details
