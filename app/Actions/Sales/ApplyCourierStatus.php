/**
 * Moves an order along its own status flow as its courier shipment
 * progresses, so the admin doesn't have to mirror every courier update by
 * hand. Every courier update path (webhook, polling sync) goes through
 * handle(); booking a shipment goes through shipmentCreated().
 *
 *   shipment booked         -> order processing              (courier pending)
 *   picked up / in transit  -> order shipped
 *   delivered               -> order delivered, fulfilled
 *   partially delivered     -> order delivered, partial      (courier returning)
 *   returning               -> order returning               (full return only)
 *   returned (by courier)   -> order returning — it becomes Returned (and is
 *                              restocked) only when the shop marks the parcel
 *                              received (Orders → "Return received")
 *
 * A partial delivery's leftover return (returning/returned after the order
 * is already delivered) only moves the courier status — the order stays
 * delivered with a partial fulfillment. Transitions only ever move forward
 * from the statuses listed in each rule, so a late or out-of-order courier
 * update can never pull an order backwards, and a closed order is never
 * touched. No accounting is posted here.
